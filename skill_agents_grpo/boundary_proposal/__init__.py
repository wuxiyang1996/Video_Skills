"""
Stage 1: High-recall boundary proposal for trajectory segmentation.

Produces candidate cut points C so that later DP/HSMM/beam search only
considers boundaries at those times (or in small windows), reducing
search from O(T^2) to O(|C|^2).

Framework integration
---------------------
- ``segment_episode(episode, env_name=...)``
    Full pipeline: extract signals from an Episode, propose boundaries,
    return SubTask_Experience segments.

- ``propose_from_episode(episode, env_name=...)``
    Propose boundary candidates from an Episode without segmenting.

- ``annotate_episode_boundaries(episode, env_name=...)``
    Mark boundaries on Experience objects so the existing
    Episode.separate_into_sub_episodes() respects them.

Signal extraction strategies
----------------------------
- ``env_name="avalon"`` etc. — rule-based (fast, brittle)
- ``env_name="llm"`` — LLM-based predicates (general, adaptive)
- ``env_name="llm+avalon"`` — hybrid: LLM predicates + per-env hard events (recommended)

Low-level API
-------------
- ``propose_boundary_candidates(T, predicates=..., surprisal=..., ...)``
    Propose from raw signal arrays.

- ``compute_changepoint_scores(embeddings, method=...)``
    CUSUM / sliding-window change-point detection from embeddings.

- ``get_signal_extractor(env_name)``
    Signal extractor factory (rule-based, LLM, or hybrid).
