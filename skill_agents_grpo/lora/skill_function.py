"""
Central function identifier for LoRA adapter routing.

Each skill-bank function maps to exactly one LoRA adapter.
Use ``SkillFunction`` as the routing key everywhere.

Three active GRPO-trained adapters: SEGMENT, CONTRACT, CURATOR.
BOUNDARY and RETRIEVAL are retained for backward compat with
``skill_agents`` base code but are **not** GRPO-trained here
(BOUNDARY reward is too indirect; RETRIEVAL uses the existing
decision-agent GRPO trainer).
