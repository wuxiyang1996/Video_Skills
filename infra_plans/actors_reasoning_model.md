# Actors (Reasoning Model) — Design Plan

> Goal: Define the **8B controller / orchestrator** that manages memory,
> perspective threads, reasoning loops, and prompt composition — the central
> "actor" that drives all video understanding tasks.
>
> **Related plans:**
> - [Video Benchmarks & Grounding](video_benchmarks_grounding.md) — benchmarks, memory graph, adapters
> - [Skill Extraction / Bank](skill_extraction_bank.md) — skill definitions and bank infrastructure
> - [Skill Synthetics Agents](skill_synthetics_agents.md) — skill crafting, evolution, quality control

## 1. Motivation

Large vision-language models (72B+) achieve strong performance on short-video
QA, but fail systematically on long-video social reasoning — questions that
require tracking hidden mental states, shifting alliances, and deceptive
behavior across tens of minutes or hours. The core bottleneck is not
perception quality but **reasoning orchestration**: deciding what to remember,
what to retrieve, and how to chain evidence across time.

We propose a **trainable 8B controller** that manages hierarchical memory,
maintains per-character perspective threads, and operates a self-evolving bank
of social inference skills. Frozen large VLMs serve only as perception tools
called on demand.

| Problem | How the small model solves it |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Large VLMs are expensive to run on every frame | 8B processes all frames; the 72B model only sees curated text + a few key frames |
| Long videos overflow context windows | The 8B model distills hours of video into a compact memory graph |
| Reasoning from scratch produces hallucinations | Pre-extracted skills give the 72B model step-by-step scaffolds grounded in visual evidence |
| No reuse across videos | The skill bank accumulates transferable reasoning patterns |
| Prompt engineering is manual and brittle | The 8B model dynamically composes prompts with retrieved memory + skills |

**Why 8B is sufficient.** The controller never processes raw pixels. It
operates over structured text — memory nodes, skill protocols, evidence
chains — a regime where 8B models are competitive with 72B on planning and
tool-use tasks. Training a small controller is also 10-20× cheaper than
fine-tuning a 72B model.

### 2.3 What the 8B Controller Does at Each Stage

| Stage | Controller Action | Frozen Tool Used |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Memory construction** | Fuses observer outputs, resolves entities, builds graph edges, distills semantic summaries, constructs perspective threads | Observers (offline, one-time) |
| **Question decomposition** | Parses question into retrieval sub-goals, identifies target entities and temporal scope | None |
| **Skill selection** | Matches question to skill bank via embedding + trigger conditions | Embedder (retrieval) |
| **Skill execution** | Runs selected skill: traverses memory graph, retrieves evidence, updates evidence chain | None (graph ops are local) |
| **Evidence sufficiency** | Evaluates whether collected evidence answers the question | None |
| **Prompt composition** | Assembles evidence chain + skill protocol + keyframes into prompt for Reasoner | None |
| **Answer generation** | Delegates to frozen Reasoner | Reasoner (single call) |
| **Verification** | Checks answer against memory for grounding, consistency, perspective correctness | None |
| **Reflection** | On failure: classifies error type, updates skill or memory accordingly | None |
| **Skill evolution** | Extracts new skills from successful traces, refines/retires based on performance | None |

### 2.4 Frozen Tool Specifications

## 3. Reasoning Core — Think / Search / Answer Loop

The single module that all benchmarks share.

### Core function

```python
def reason(
    question: str,
    options: Optional[List[str]],
    video_context: Union[str, List[str], "VideoMemoryGraph"],
    vlm_fn: Callable,
    max_iterations: int = 5,
    mode: str = "auto",  # "direct" | "retrieval" | "auto"
) -> ReasoningResult:
```

### Two execution paths

**Direct mode** (short video — Video-Holmes, SIV-Bench):

`video_context` is raw frames/transcript fed directly to the VLM. No graph,
no retrieval. Pure chain-of-thought reasoning.

```
VLM receives: [video frames] + [question + options]
         ├─ [Think] reason about what is observed
         ├─ [Think] connect cues / infer mental states / apply physics
         └─ [Answer] final answer
```

**Retrieval mode** (long video — VRBench, LongVideoBench, CG-Bench, M3-Bench):

`video_context` is a `VideoMemoryGraph`. The VLM issues `[Search]` queries to
retrieve relevant memories.

```
VLM receives: [question] + [memory context so far]
         ├─ [Think] what do I need to know?
         ├─ [Search] "who was in the kitchen at 3:00?"
         │     → system retrieves from graph, injects results
         ├─ [Think] connect retrieved evidence
         ├─ [Search] "what did face_0 say about the cup?"
         │     → system retrieves, injects
         └─ [Answer] final answer
```

**Auto mode** (default): checks video duration against a configurable
threshold (e.g. 5 min). Below → direct. Above → retrieval.

### Iteration protocol

| Tag | Meaning | System action |
|---|---|---|
| `[Think] <reflection>` | Internal reasoning step | Append to chain-of-thought; continue |
| `[Search] <query>` | Request information from memory | Run `graph.search(query)`, inject results. **Retrieval mode only.** |
| `[Answer] <answer>` | Final answer | Stop; return answer + full reasoning chain |

### Output

```python
@dataclass
class ReasoningResult:
    answer: str
    thinking_chain: List[str]
    retrieved_contexts: List[str]   # empty in direct mode
    n_iterations: int
    mode_used: str                  # "direct" | "retrieval"
    confidence: Optional[float]
```

## 4. Hierarchical Memory Design

### 4.1 Three Timescale Levels

```
Arc Level (minutes–hours)
  │  Relationship trajectories, alliances, plans, suspicion arcs
  │  "How did trust between A and B evolve?"
  │
  ├── Episode Level (tens of seconds–minutes)
  │     Conversations, conflicts, joint activities, subgoals
  │     "What happened during the dinner argument?"
  │
  └──── Event Level (seconds)
          Individual actions, utterances, expressions, object states
          "Did A see B pick up the envelope?"
```

| Level | Grain | Content | Created By |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Event** | 1–10 s | A single action, utterance, expression change, or object manipulation | Controller ingests observer JSON → one event node per detected action/dialogue/state change |
| **Episode** | 30 s – 5 min | A coherent interaction: a conversation, a conflict, a shared activity | Controller clusters temporally adjacent events with shared participants and causal links |
| **Arc** | minutes – full video | A long-range development: alliance formation, trust erosion, a plan unfolding | Controller distills episode sequences into arc summaries |

### 4.2 Memory Node Schema

```python
@dataclass
class MemoryNode:
    node_id: str
    level: str              # "event" | "episode" | "arc"
    timestamp: Tuple[float, float]
    entity_ids: List[str]
    content: Dict[str, Any] # level-specific fields
    embedding: Optional[np.ndarray]
    confidence: float       # 0–1, decays if contradicted
    provenance: str         # "observed" | "inferred"
    source_ids: List[str]   # IDs of supporting lower-level nodes
```

**Event-level content:**
```python
{
    "type": "action" | "utterance" | "expression" | "object_state",
    "description": "A picks up envelope from table",
    "agent": "face_3",
    "target": "obj_12",
    "witnesses": ["face_5"],
    "dialogue": {"speaker": "face_3", "text": "...", "tone": "..."},
    "spatial_context": {"location": "kitchen", "layout": "..."},
}
```

**Episode-level content:**
```python
{
    "summary": "A confronts B about the missing money; B denies involvement",
    "interaction_type": "confrontation" | "cooperation" | "negotiation" | ...,
    "outcome": "unresolved — A remains suspicious",
    "key_events": ["evt_042", "evt_043", "evt_047"],
    "social_dynamics": {
        "trust_change": {"face_3→face_7": -0.3},
        "information_revealed": ["face_3 now knows B was in the room"],
        "deception_detected": false,
    },
}
```

**Arc-level content:**
```python
{
    "summary": "B systematically conceals evidence from A across 3 episodes",
    "arc_type": "deception" | "alliance" | "betrayal" | "investigation" | ...,
    "trajectory": [
        {"episode_id": "ep_005", "state": "B hides envelope"},
        {"episode_id": "ep_012", "state": "B deflects A's questions"},
        {"episode_id": "ep_019", "state": "A finds contradictory evidence"},
    ],
    "resolution": "pending" | "resolved" | "escalated",
}
```

### 4.3 Graph Edges

| Edge Type | Connects | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `contains` | Episode → Event, Arc → Episode | Hierarchical nesting |
| `precedes` | Node → Node (same level) | Temporal ordering |
| `causes` | Event → Event | Causal link |
| `supports` | Event → Episode/Arc | Evidence for a higher-level conclusion |
| `contradicts` | Event → Episode/Arc | Counter-evidence |
| `participates` | Entity → Event/Episode | Character involvement |
| `witnesses` | Entity → Event | Character was present and could observe |
| `trusts` / `suspects` | Entity → Entity | Social relation at a time point |
| `believes` | Entity → MemoryNode | Attributed belief (may differ from ground truth) |

---

## 5. Perspective-Aware Social Memory

### 5.1 The Perspective Confusion Problem

The most common failure in social reasoning is **perspective confusion**:
the system answers based on what the viewer knows, rather than what a
specific character knows.

> Q: "Does Alice know that Bob stole the key?"
> Correct: No — Alice was not in the room when Bob took it.
> Common error: Yes — the system saw Bob take it and projects that knowledge onto Alice.

### 5.2 Perspective Thread Schema

```python
@dataclass
class PerspectiveThread:
    entity_id: str
    entity_name: str
    observed_events: List[str]
    heard_dialogue: List[str]
    inferred_beliefs: List[SocialStateEntry]
    goals: List[str]
    knowledge_boundary: str   # summary of what this character does NOT know
    last_updated: float
    update_history: List[Dict]
```

### 5.3 Social-State Entry Schema

```python
@dataclass
class SocialStateEntry:
    entry_id: str
    entities: List[str]
    state_type: str    # "belief" | "intention" | "trust" | "suspicion" | "commitment" | "deception"
    description: str
    timestamp: Tuple[float, float]
    confidence: float

    provenance: str    # "directly_observed" | "inferred_from_dialogue" | "inferred_from_behavior" | "inferred_from_absence"
    supporting_evidence: List[str]
    contradicting_evidence: List[str]
    alternative_hypotheses: List[str]
    is_active: bool    # false if superseded by later state
```

### 5.4 Perspective Thread Construction

1. For each event, check `witnesses` to determine present characters.
2. Add event to `observed_events` of each witness.
3. For dialogue events, add to `heard_dialogue` of speaker and listeners.
4. After each episode, run a belief-update pass: infer what each character
   likely believes based on what they've observed and heard.
5. Flag cases where a character's perspective diverges from ground truth.

### 5.5 Perspective-Aware Retrieval

When the controller encounters "Does A know X?":
1. Retrieve A's perspective thread, not the global memory.
2. Check whether the relevant event is in A's `observed_events`.
3. If not, check whether A could have learned through dialogue or inference.
4. Return answer with explicit evidence trail.

---

## 6. Question Analyzer

When a question arrives, the 8B model decomposes it into structured
retrieval signals.

```python
@dataclass
class QuestionAnalysis:
    question_type: str          # "SR", "TCI", "MHR", "PAR", "CTI"
    target_entities: List[str]
    temporal_scope: str         # "full_video" | "segment" | "point_in_time"
    temporal_hint: Optional[Tuple[float, float]]
    required_evidence: List[str]
    reasoning_type: str         # "causal" | "temporal" | "relational" | "descriptive"
    retrieval_queries: List[str]
    skill_tags: List[str]
    difficulty_estimate: str    # "simple" | "moderate" | "hard"
```

### Adaptive Routing

| Difficulty | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| **simple** | 8B answers directly from memory graph |
| **moderate** | 8B composes prompt, 72B answers |
| **hard** | 8B composes prompt with extra skills + more memory, 72B answers with CoT |

This routing saves 72B inference cost on ~30-40% of questions.

---

## 7. Keyframe Selector

```python
def select_keyframes(
    question_analysis: QuestionAnalysis,
    memory_graph: VideoMemoryGraph,
    retrieved_memories: List[MemoryNode],
    max_frames: int = 5,
) -> List[KeyFrame]:
```

1. **Temporal anchoring:** frames from timestamps of retrieved memory nodes
2. **Entity anchoring:** frames containing target entities
3. **Diversity sampling:** span different segments
4. **Saliency scoring:** 8B model scores candidate frames by relevance

| Scenario | Max frames | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Simple factual | 1-2 | Verification only |
| Relationship / causal | 3-5 | Need multiple moments |
| Temporal ordering | 5-8 | Representative moments from each segment |

---

## 8. Prompt Composer

The 8B model assembles a structured prompt for the 72B model:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  SYSTEM                                            ║

### Token Budget Management

| Section | Token budget | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| System + instructions | ~300 | Fixed |
| Skills (top-k) | ~800 (k=3) | High — reasoning scaffold |
| Memory context | ~1200 (top-5 nodes) | High — factual grounding |
| Visual frames | ~5000 (5 frames) | Medium — visual grounding |
| Question + options | ~200 | Fixed |
| **Total** | **~7500** | Fits within 32K context |

---

## 9. Self-Reflection Loop

After the 72B model produces an answer, the 8B model verifies it:

1. **Claim extraction:** 8B extracts factual claims from the 72B answer
2. **Memory grounding:** search memory graph for each claim; flag ungrounded claims
3. **Temporal consistency:** verify reasoning chain respects temporal order
4. **Entity consistency:** verify entity references match entity nodes

| Verification outcome | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| All claims grounded | Accept answer |
| 1-2 ungrounded claims | Re-prompt 72B with corrections |
| Major contradiction | Re-compose prompt with additional memory and re-run |
| Temporal error | Re-compose with explicit timeline and re-run |

Max **2 iterations** to bound cost.

---

## 10. Training the 8B Controller

### 10.1 What Is Trained

**Only the 8B controller.** All other components are frozen.

| Component | Trainable? | Optimization Target |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **8B Controller** | **Yes** | Memory management, skill selection, retrieval planning, evidence sufficiency, verification, reflection |
| Observer-A/B (72B) | No | Frozen perception tools |
| Reasoner (72B) | No | Frozen answer generator |
| Embedders | No | Frozen retrieval index |
| Skill Bank | Evolves (not gradient-trained) | Updated by reflection logic |

### 10.2 LoRA Adapters

| Adapter | Input | Output | When Active |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `memory_builder` | Observer JSON / video frames | Memory graph update commands / structured observation JSON | Offline memory construction |
| `planner` | Question + memory state | Skill selection + retrieval plan | Online, per question |
| `question_analyzer` | Question text | QuestionAnalysis JSON | Online, per question |
| `prompt_composer` | Context bundle | Optimized prompt | Online, per question |
| `verifier` | Answer + evidence chain + memory | Accept / reject / retry decision | Online, post-answer |
| `reflector` | Failed trace + ground truth | Failure classification + skill update | Post-evaluation |
| `self_reflector` | Answer + memory | Verification judgement | Online, post-answer |

### 10.3 Dual-Thread Reward

Every question runs through two parallel threads: one with skill bank access,
one without.

| A Correct? | B Correct? | `r_outcome` | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Yes | No | **+1.0** | Skills were the deciding factor |
| Yes | Yes | **+0.2** | Skills at least didn't hurt |
| No | No | **-0.3** | Skills failed to help |
| No | Yes | **-1.0** | Skills actively damaged reasoning |

### 10.4 Step-Level Reward

| Signal | Value | Condition |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `r_evidence` | **+0.1** | Retrieved a new, relevant memory node |
| `r_grounding` | **+0.15** | Grounded a question entity in the graph |
| `r_progress` | **+0.2** | Closed an identified evidence gap |
| `r_novel_info` | **+0.1** | Found non-redundant information |
| `p_turn_cost` | **-0.05** | Per-turn fixed cost (encourages efficiency) |
| `p_redundant` | **-0.10** | Re-retrieved already-known information |
| `p_irrelevant` | **-0.15** | Retrieved low-relevance evidence |
| `p_wrong_skill` | **-0.20** | Invoked a skill with unmet preconditions |
| `p_hallucination` | **-0.30** | Claim not grounded in any memory node |

### 10.5 Composite Reward

```
R = 0.35 × r_outcome
  + 0.25 × (step_total_A - step_total_B)
  + 0.20 × (evidence_quality_A - evidence_quality_B)
  + 0.10 × efficiency_bonus
  + 0.10 × step_total_A
```

### 10.6 Training via GRPO

The composite reward feeds into Group Relative Policy Optimization. The
controller learns when to invoke skills, which skills to select, how to
compose multi-step chains, and when to stop gathering evidence.

| Training Phase | Data Source | Signal |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| **Cold start** | Video-Holmes + MA-EgoQA | Outcome reward only |
| **Skill evolution** | Same benchmarks, iterative | Dual-thread reward with step-level scoring |
| **Cross-benchmark transfer** | Train on one, evaluate on another | Skill bank portability signal |

## 12. Latency Analysis

### 12.1 Online Phase — Per-Question Latency

```
Question ──► 8B calls (~3-5 s) ──► 72B call (~15-25 s) ──► Answer
```

| Step | Model | Latency |
|------|-------|---------|
| Question analysis | 8B | ~1.2 s |
| Memory retrieval | Embedding search (CPU) | ~50 ms |
| Skill retrieval | Embedding search (CPU) | ~50 ms |
| Keyframe selection | 8B | ~1.5 s |
| Prompt composition | CPU | ~10 ms |
| **72B inference** | 72B on 4×A100 | **~18 s** |
| Self-reflection (opt.) | 8B | ~2 s |
| **Total per question** | | **~23 s** |

### 12.2 Comparison: Orchestrator vs Raw 72B

| Approach | 72B input tokens | Total |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| 72B on all 60 frames (raw) | ~60K | **40-50 s** |
| 72B on 15 sampled frames | ~15K | **22-30 s** |
| **Orchestrator (8B + 72B)** | **~7.5K** | **~20-25 s** |
| Orchestrator (simple Q, 8B only) | 0 | **~2-3 s** |

The orchestrator's online latency is **constant** regardless of video
length because the memory graph compresses the video into a fixed-size
text representation.

### 12.3 Deployment Scenarios

| Scenario | Config | Per-Q latency | Hardware |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Research eval** | 8B + 72B + reflection | ~23 s | 1 + 4 A100s |
| **Fast eval** | 8B + 72B, no reflection | ~18 s | 1 + 4 A100s |
| **Budget** | 8B + 32B, no reflection | ~10-12 s | 1 + 2 A100s |
| **API** | 8B local + GPT-5.4 API | ~8-15 s | 1 A100 + API |
| **8B only** | 8B with routing | ~2-3 s | 1 A100 |

### 12.4 Batch Throughput

| Batch size | Per-question amortized | Questions/hour |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|
| 1 (sequential) | ~23 s | ~156 |
| 4 (concurrent) | ~8-10 s | ~360-450 |
| 8 (concurrent, 8B batched) | ~6-8 s | ~450-600 |

## 14. Future Extensions

### A. Online Skill Learning
When the 72B model discovers a novel reasoning pattern, the 8B model
packages it as a new skill and adds it to the bank — creating a
co-evolution loop.

### B. Multi-Turn Dialogue
The 8B model maintains a conversation memory alongside the video memory
graph, allowing the prompt composer to include dialogue history.

### C. Real-Time Video Processing
The 8B model runs the observe pipeline in real time (1 fps), continuously
updating the memory graph.

### D. Hierarchical Multi-Model Cascade
For extremely long videos (10+ hours):
```
Qwen3-VL-3B (frame-level triage, ~6 GB)
    → Qwen3-VL-8B (segment-level reasoning, ~16 GB)
        → Qwen3-VL-72B (question answering, ~144 GB)
```
