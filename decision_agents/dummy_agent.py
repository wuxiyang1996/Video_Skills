"""
Dummy language agent for multi-game environments: takes state (natural language)
and generates action (natural language) using an LLM (GPT / ask_model).

Supports env_wrappers for 6 games:
  - GamingAgent (LMGame-Bench): 2048, Candy Crush, Tetris, Super Mario Bros
  - AvalonNLWrapper:   hidden-role deduction (actions: team proposals, approve/reject, pass/fail, target)
  - DiplomacyNLWrapper: strategic negotiation (actions: order strings like "A PAR - BUR")

The agent auto-detects which game is being played from the observation text, or
can be told explicitly via the `game` parameter.

Experience Collection:
  Use `run_episode_with_experience_collection()` to run a full episode and automatically
  collect all experiences in an Episode object following the data structure defined
  in data_structure.experience. Each step creates an Experience object with state,
  action, reward, next_state, and done fields, all stored within the Episode.

Usage with AvalonNLWrapper (single-agent):

  from env_wrappers import AvalonNLWrapper
  from agents.dummy_agent import language_agent_action

  env = AvalonNLWrapper(num_players=5, controlled_player=0)
  obs, info = env.reset()
  action = language_agent_action(obs, model="gpt-4o-mini")
  obs, reward, term, trunc, info = env.step(action)

Usage with AvalonNLWrapper (multi-agent):

  from env_wrappers import AvalonNLWrapper
  from agents.dummy_agent import language_agent_action

  env = AvalonNLWrapper(num_players=5)
  obs, info = env.reset()         # obs: {player_id: nl_str}
  actions = {
      pid: language_agent_action(obs_str, model="gpt-4o-mini")
      for pid, obs_str in obs.items()
  }
  obs, rewards, term, trunc, info = env.step(actions)

Usage with DiplomacyNLWrapper (single-agent):

  from env_wrappers import DiplomacyNLWrapper
  from agents.dummy_agent import language_agent_action

  env = DiplomacyNLWrapper(controlled_power="FRANCE")
  obs, info = env.reset()
  action = language_agent_action(obs, model="gpt-4o-mini")
  obs, reward, term, trunc, info = env.step(action)

Usage with DiplomacyNLWrapper (multi-agent):

  from env_wrappers import DiplomacyNLWrapper
  from agents.dummy_agent import language_agent_action

  env = DiplomacyNLWrapper()
  obs, info = env.reset()         # obs: {power_name: nl_str}
  actions = {
      power: language_agent_action(obs_str, model="gpt-4o-mini")
      for power, obs_str in obs.items()
