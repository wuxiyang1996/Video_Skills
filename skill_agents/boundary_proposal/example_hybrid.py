"""
Walkthrough: how the hybrid (LLM + rule-based) extractor works.

This example simulates a 12-step Overcooked trajectory and shows exactly
what each layer (LLM predicates vs rule-based events) contributes to the
final boundary candidates.

Run from repo root:
    python -m skill_agents.boundary_proposal.example_hybrid

No real LLM call is made — we mock ask_model to show the data flow.
