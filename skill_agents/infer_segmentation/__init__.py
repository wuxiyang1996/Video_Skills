"""
Stage 2: InferSegmentation — preference-learned skill-sequence decoding.

The LLM acts as a **preference teacher**: it ranks skills for each segment
(not numeric scores).  A ``PreferenceScorer`` is trained from those rankings
via Bradley-Terry, then used by DP/beam decoders for optimal segmentation.

Pipeline:
  1. Stage 1 proposes candidate boundaries C.
  2. LLM teacher ranks skills for candidate segments → pairwise preferences.
  3. Train PreferenceScorer from preferences.
  4. Decode with trained scorer (DP or beam).
  5. On uncertain segments, query LLM for more preferences → retrain → re-decode.

High-level API
--------------
- ``infer_and_segment(episode, skill_names, ...)``
    Inference with LLM (e.g. GPT-5): Stage 1 → LLM preferences → train → decode.
    Use when you want to interface with an LLM at inference time.

- ``infer_and_segment_offline(episode, skill_names, ...)``
    Offline (no LLM): decode using provided behavior_fit_fn and transition_fn only.
    Use for training from pre-collected preferences, or testing without API.

- ``infer_segmentation(candidates, T, skill_names, ...)``
    Low-level: run decoder with a given scorer.

LLM Teacher
-----------
- ``collect_segment_preferences(segments, ...)``
    Cold-start: LLM ranks skills for every segment.

- ``collect_uncertain_preferences(result, ...)``
    Active learning: LLM resolves uncertain segments only.

- ``collect_transition_preferences(skill_names, ...)``
    LLM ranks transition likelihoods between skills.
