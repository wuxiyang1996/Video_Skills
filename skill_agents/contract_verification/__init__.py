"""
Stage 3: ContractVerification — skill bank construction and verification.

Given segmented trajectories from Stage 2 (segments with skill labels,
including ``__NEW__``), build and maintain a Skill Bank where each skill
has a verifiable contract:

  - **Pre** (preconditions)
  - **Eff+** / **Eff-** (add/delete effects)
  - **Inv** (invariants)

and a verification report that triggers:

  - **KEEP** — contract holds, no changes needed.
  - **REFINE** — drop/soften unstable literals.
  - **SPLIT** — instances cluster into distinct sub-skills.
  - **MATERIALIZE_NEW** — repeated ``__NEW__`` segments become a new skill.

Pipeline:
  1. Extract per-timestep predicates and build smoothed summaries.
  2. Compute per-instance add/delete effects.
  3. Aggregate into initial contracts per skill.
  4. Verify contracts and produce counterexamples.
  5. Decide KEEP / REFINE / SPLIT actions.
  6. Materialize ``__NEW__`` segments into new skills.
  7. Persist updates with versioning.

High-level API
--------------
- ``run_stage3(result, traj_id, observations, ...)``
    Full pipeline: extract predicates → contracts → verify → update bank.

- ``run_stage3_batch(results_and_obs, ...)``
    Process multiple trajectories into one bank.

Skill Bank
----------
- ``SkillBank`` — persistent skill bank with versioning and ``compat_fn``
  for Stage 2 integration.

Stage 2 Integration
-------------------
After running Stage 3, feed the bank back to Stage 2:

    >>> scorer = SegmentScorer(
    ...     skill_names=bank.get_skill_names(),
    ...     config=config,
    ...     compat_fn=bank.compat_fn,
    ... )
