# Fitting Intention-Based Skill Extraction into SkillBankAgent

## The Root Problem

There is a **type mismatch** between what the intention-extracted contracts expect
and what the predicate system actually produces at runtime.

Contracts (from intention-based extraction in `label_and_extract_skills_gpt54.py`) store:

```
eff_add = {"clear_completed"}
eff_event = {"tag_clear"}
```

But `_extract_predicates` in `infer_segmentation/episode_adapter.py` returns:

```python
{"intention": "[CLEAR] Push box onto target", "done": False}
```

So `_effects_compat_score` (in `skill_agents/skill_bank/bank.py`) can never match
`"clear_completed"` against the predicate dict — every effect clause hits
`missing_penalty = -0.5`, and the contracts are dead weight.

---

## Strategy A: Seed the Bank (Warm Start) — ~20 lines

**Idea:** Load the 48 intention-extracted skills into the bank, then patch the
consumer side so Stage 2 can actually score segments against them.

### What exists today

- `label_and_extract_skills_gpt54.py` already calls `agent.bank.add_or_update(contract)`
  for the fallback skills. The 48 contracts sit in `skill_bank.jsonl`.
- Stage 2 defaults `skill_names = list(self.bank.skill_ids)` when the bank is
  non-empty, so seeded skills would automatically enter the decode label set.

### What needs to change

Patch `_extract_predicates` in `skill_agents/infer_segmentation/episode_adapter.py`
to parse the `[TAG]` from intentions into keys the contracts understand:

```python
# Before (raw string, useless for matching):
preds["intention"] = exp.intentions

# After (keys that match contract effects):
import re
tag_m = re.match(r"\[(\w+)\]", (exp.intentions or "").strip())
if tag_m:
    tag = tag_m.group(1).lower()
    preds[f"tag_{tag}"] = 1.0
    preds[f"{tag}_completed"] = float(getattr(exp, "done", False))
```

### Scope & limitations

- Only fixes Stage 2 scoring. Stage 1 boundary proposals still rely on embedding
  changepoints + reward spikes; the tag is just one more signal.
- Stage 3 contract learning still sees sparse predicate dicts.
- Only works on LLM-labeled episodes (those with `intentions`).

---

## Strategy B: Replace the Predicate Extractor with Intention Tags — ~80 lines

**Idea:** The `[TAG]` in intentions is effectively a high-quality, LLM-generated
predicate. Wire it directly into the predicate system via a new
`SignalExtractorBase` subclass.

### Key abstraction (already exists)

```
skill_agents/boundary_proposal/signal_extractors.py

class SignalExtractorBase(ABC):
    extract_predicates(experiences) -> List[Optional[dict]]
    extract_event_times(experiences) -> List[int]
```

Factory: `get_signal_extractor(env_name, **kwargs)` — supports `"overcooked"`,
`"avalon"`, `"diplomacy"`, `"generic"`, `"llm"`, `"llm+overcooked"`, etc.

### What to build

```python
class IntentionSignalExtractor(SignalExtractorBase):
    def extract_predicates(self, experiences):
        predicates = []
        for exp in experiences:
            intent = getattr(exp, "intentions", "") or ""
            m = re.match(r"\[(\w+)\]", intent.strip())
            tag = m.group(1).upper() if m else "UNKNOWN"
            preds = {f"tag_{t.lower()}": float(t == tag) for t in SUBGOAL_TAGS}
            predicates.append(preds)
        return predicates

    def extract_event_times(self, experiences):
        events = []
        for t, exp in enumerate(experiences):
            if getattr(exp, "done", False):
                events.append(t)
        return events
```

Register as `"intention"` in `get_signal_extractor`.

### What improves (vs Strategy A)

| Stage | Improvement |
|-------|-------------|
| Stage 1 (boundary proposal) | Tag changes become explicit boundary candidates (not just embedding changepoints) |
| Stage 2 (segmentation) | `{tag_clear: 1.0, tag_attack: 0.0, ...}` → contracts have real compat scores |
| Stage 3 (contract learning) | Can learn/verify patterns like "skill_X starts with tag_setup=1, ends with tag_clear=1" |
| Materialization | Effect signatures are meaningful → clustering works |

### Limitations

- Only works on episodes that have `intentions` (LLM-labeled data).
- Raw rollouts from the coevolution loop (`RolloutStep`) don't have intentions.

---

## Strategy C: Full Closed-Loop (Longer Term)

**Idea:** Use A or B as Gen 0, then iterate the coevolution loop that already
exists in `trainer/launch_coevolution.py` and `trainer/skillbank/em_trainer.py`.

### Existing loop structure

```
launch_coevolution.py:
  while episode_count < total_episodes:
    1. collect_batch (with current bank)
    2. grpo_trainer.train_step
    3. periodic eval
    4. em_trainer.run(trajectories)   ← Stage 0→4 on real rollouts
       → commit or rollback bank

em_trainer.py EM loop:
    1. enrich_trajectory_predicates (Stage 0)
    2. For each iteration:
       a. propose_cuts        (Stage 1)
       b. decode_batch         (Stage 2)
       c. learn_contracts      (Stage 3)
       d. run_update           (Stage 4: refine, materialize, merge, split)
    3. SkillEval gating on holdout
    4. Commit or rollback
```

### The gap

The trainer EM path (`stage0_predicates.py`) uses
`extract_predicates_from_text(observation_text, predicate_vocabulary)` — keyword/regex
matching on raw observations. It does **not** have access to intentions because
`RolloutStep` doesn't store them.

### What needs to change for C

Option 1: Add `intentions` to `RolloutStep`
- Populate from the decision agent's `get_intention` tool during rollout collection
- Extend `ingest_rollouts` and `enrich_trajectory_predicates` to map intentions → predicates

Option 2: Lightweight intention tagger
- Small LLM call or classifier in `stage0_predicates` that produces `[TAG]` from raw obs
- Avoids changing the rollout collection path

### Generation flow

```
Gen 0: Intention-based extraction → 48 skills (what we have now)
    ↓ seed bank
Gen 1: Run new episodes with skill-conditioned policy
    ↓ SkillBankAgent segments with seeded bank
    ↓ Stage 3 refines contracts from real execution data
    ↓ Bank maintenance: split/merge/refine
Gen 2+: Repeat with growing bank
```

## Comparison

| | A: Seed | B: Replace Extractor | C: Full Loop |
|---|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| **What adapts** | Consumer (`_effects_compat_score` or `_extract_predicates`) | Producer (new `SignalExtractorBase`) | Infrastructure (`RolloutStep` + EM pipeline) |
| **Where the fix lives** | `episode_adapter.py` (one function) | `signal_extractors.py` (new class) + factory | `rollout_collector.py` + `ingest_rollouts.py` + `stage0_predicates.py` |
| **Stages improved** | Stage 2 only | Stage 1 + 2 + 3 + materialization | All stages, iteratively |
| **Works on** | LLM-labeled episodes | LLM-labeled episodes | Live rollouts (needs intentions in rollout path) |
| **Effort** | ~20 lines | ~80 lines + wiring | Moderate refactor across trainer path |

---

## Recommended Path

**Start with B**, then build toward C:

1. **B now** — lights up the full pipeline for labeled data. Not much more work
   than A, but Stage 1 boundaries become much cleaner (tag changes are explicit
   boundary proposals instead of just embedding changepoints).

2. **C next** — once B validates that intention-based predicates make the pipeline
   work end-to-end, plumb intentions into the rollout collection path so the
   coevolution loop can self-improve the skill bank on live data.
